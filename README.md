This secure Messaging App is a Flask-based web application that allows users to send encrypted messages securely. Without user accounts and with any username you choose. Utilizing RSA encryption, messages between senders and receivers are encrypted and decrypted, ensuring that only the intended recipient can read the message content. Messages are deleted once read.

RSA Encryption for secure messaging.
Flask-WTF for form handling and CSRF protection.
Flask-Limiter for request rate limiting.
Flask-SQLAlchemy for database integration.
